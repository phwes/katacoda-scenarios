This is a tutorial that will go trough:  
  
1. Build and run MySQL from a docker image.
2. Build and run apache with php from a docker image,
3. Make the containers communicate with each other and use persistent storage. 
  
This tutorial is just intended for learning and does not apply best practices. For example, the MySQL database will be accessed with the root account, which would be a serious security flaw.
