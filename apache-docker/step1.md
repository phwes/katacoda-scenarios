## Update system
Katacoda's ubuntu image has not updated it's PPAs for a while. This might take a while:  
`apt update`{{execute}}  
To interact with our mysql container, when it has been started, we will use the normal mysql-client:  
`apt install mysql-client`{{execute}}  

## Downloading images
Docker is built around so called images...  

`docker pull mysql`{{execute}}  
`docker pull httpd`{{execute}}  

## Set up MySQL container
First we will start an MySQL container...  
`docker run --name m1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=guest -d mysql`{{execute}}  
To access...  
`mysql -uroot -pguest -h 172.18.0.2 -P 3306`{{execute}}  
Try a command...  
`show databases;`{{execute}}
